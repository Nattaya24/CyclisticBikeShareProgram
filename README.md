Google Data Analytics Capstone: Cyclistic Bike-Share customer analysis using Python

This project contains my approach to solving the business tasks of the bike-share company. This is the capstone project for the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate. In order to answer the key business questions, the six steps of the data analysis process were implemented: ask, prepare, process, analyze, share, and act. For this project, I approached the solution using Excel and Python.

## Business Goals
Design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members because maximizing the number of annual members will be key to future growth.

Why: The team believes there is a very good chance to convert casual riders into members because they are already aware of the Cyclistic program.

## Business tasks
In order to reach the goal, the marketing team needs to better understand how annual members and casual riders differ and why casual riders would buy a membership.

## Data Source
The dataset we used to analyze is historical trip data from a bike-share program. Although the data set is available from April 2020 until June 2023, we will only use the historical data in 2022 (January 2022â€“December 2022) for the full-year analysis.
